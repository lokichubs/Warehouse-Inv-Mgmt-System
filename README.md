# Warehouse Inventory Management Software Development
This project's goal is to create a inventory stock keeping system and add functionalities such as
report generation for a client, Ms. XX, from the company Karadi Path (an education company in India).

The implementation of the Software was done in 5 parts:

[Planning](#planning)

[Design](#design)

[Development](#development)

[Functionality](#functionality)

[Evaluation](#evaluation)

## Planning
This phase involved communication with the client to determine the sucess criteria of the final software.
The documentation for the same can be seen below.

[Consultation with Client](Documentation/Appendix_Consultation.pdf)

[Success Criteria](Documentation/Crit_A_Planning.pdf)

After consulation, the software front end was chosen to be written in JAVA (Netbeans) and the back end be written in SQL.

## Design
This phase involved several steps prior to coding such as Wire framing, Database Normalization, Entity Relationship Diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams, Flowcharts, Unified Modelling Language Diagrams, and Test Plan.
The documentation for the same can be seen below.

*Note: The resulting final software design can be seen at the end of design process document as well

## Development
This phase involved the coding of the software in JAVA and MySQL and the techniques deployed in the process. 
Then documentation for the same can be seen below.
